Jumper Game

This game is just like the game "Hang Man." A word is randomly chosen, and blanks are displayed for every letter in the word. The player has to guess the word one letter at a time. As wrong letters are guessed, the "jumper" loses more of his parachute. If the jumper loses all of his parachute, the game is over, and if the player guesses all the letters in the word, the game is over.

Begin the game from the __main__.py file
